Simulated Healthcare Breach Analysis & Incident Response Reflection.

- Documented a simulated ransomware attack on a U.S. healthcare clinic that resulted in operational shutdown due to encrypted medical files.
- Analyzed the root cause—a phishing campaign leading to malware execution—and recorded key response details using an incident handler's journal.
- Captured the timeline, threat actor methods, and impact while reflecting on mitigation strategies and future prevention measures.
- Learned how to structure real-world incident reports, identify attack vectors, and apply analytical thinking under simulated pressure.
